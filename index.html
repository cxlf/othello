            After a thorough investigation and deciphering crucial clues, the truth behind the tragic events has finally come to light. Iago, driven by deep-seated jealousy over not being promoted and fueled by unfounded suspicions that his wife Emilia had an affair with Othello, orchestrated a devious plot to ruin those around him. His manipulation extended to planting false evidence of Desdemonaâ€™s infidelity, which tragically misled Othello into taking drastic actions.
